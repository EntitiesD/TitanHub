TitanHub
=======

TitanHub is a project I've been writing for my server, TitanCore.

It is thoroughly tested on an Offline-Mode server, so you can bet it's rock solid and feather light!

Dependencies are in lib/ folder, and also requires CraftBukkit or Spigot which are freely available online (Last compiled on spigot for Minecraft 1.8)

MySQL
SQLite (Flatfile)
